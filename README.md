# Project Van Eyk

`Implementation of the [siren](https://vsitzmann.github.io/siren/) paper (first principle method)`
`All the libraries are done in C/C++ from scratch`

TODO: 
  == tensor library ==
      1. custom tensor making capabilities
          input what ever the array -> output the tensor  
      2. input tensor shape, data type=float32 -> output tensor with numbers (numbers are chosen using distributions)
      3. add/minus tensors -> added tensor
      4. tensor, constant -> multiplied tensor
      5. input two tensors -> dot/cross
      6. two tensors -> deep copy
      7. two tensors -> shallow copy

  == python binding ==
      1. importing the library -> import vaneyk as eyk
      2. making the tensor -> eyk.tensor() 

  == implementing the paper ==
