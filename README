# Project Van Eyk

ENLI 6.7377|81.1031|0|31 c

** Implementation of latest papers using first principles.
** To get deep understanding of the field of AI.

** All the papers are implemented using custom DL library. Named as vaneyk (Van Eyck is an ancient painter :))

implement in functions F
  matmul :: matrix multiplication
  add    :: matrix add 

backprop ::
  find loss function :: mse :: done
  find a way to minimize the los -> use update methods .. Adam, SGD :: currently doing adam
  loss.backward() -> this will backpropagate and change the weights
